This is a series of GraphViz visualizations to accompany "SERVER-50758
Investigate FCV code for opportunities to refactor". The base file
fcv_components.gv is a GraphViz file that reflects the state of the Feature
Compatibility Version code today. You can apply a series of patches that
illustrate how we plan to change the code.

This requires the "dot" tool from GraphViz and the "quilt" tool to manage the
series of patches. On Mac, "brew install quilt graphviz".

# Go to the initial state.
quilt pop -a

# Apply the next patch.
quilt push

# Undo the top patch.
quilt pop

# Show which patches are applied.
quilt applied

# To add a new patch to the series:
quilt push -a
quilt new NAME-OF-NEW-PATCH
quilt add fcv_components/fcv_components.gv
# ... make your modifications to fcv_components.gv ...
quilt refresh

# Regenerate .png images of the graph - requires Python 3.6+.
python3 generate_graph_images.py
